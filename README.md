Getting started

Hi Humans,

I am new to programming and committed to self learning. My key areas of interest are Data Science and Artificial Intelligence all in the pursuit to solving world problems. To me "The World is Driven by Ideas" couldn't carry more truth in imagining the future. I am from Nairobi Kenya and I look forwarding to learning and collaborating with all of you.
